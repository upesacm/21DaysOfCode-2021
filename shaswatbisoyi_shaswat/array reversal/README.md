Question : Reverse a 1D array consisting of integer elements and display it through functions.
<br>
solution : created two functions one for printing and one for reversal. took two variables start and end in order to swap the first and last element of the array and kept reducing one from each variable until start < end (using while loop) and kept swappng. once the the while loop terminated the array would be reversed.
