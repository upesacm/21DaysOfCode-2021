### Documentation
To begin this coding journey, I started with some comparitively easier questions. The question has been taken from the **Easy** questions section of the **Practice** menu of  **Codechef.**

### Question

Everyone loves short problem statements.

Given a function f(x) find its minimum value over the range 0 < x < π/2 :

f(x)=(x2+b∗x+c)/sin(x)

Input:

First-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, two real numbers b,c.

Output:

For each test case, output the minimum value of f(x) over the given range. Absolute error of 10−6 is allowed.

Constraints

1≤T≤100000
1≤b,c≤20

Sample Input:

1
2 2

Sample Output:

5.8831725615
