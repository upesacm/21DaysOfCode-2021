Question:

Sorting Algorithms in C++ (Bubble Sort,Insertion Sort,Selection Sort)

- Taking Input of an array and number to be searched from user 
- Using switch statement to call different types of sorting techniques as per the choice entered
- Functions included :   
                        </br>
                        ->Bubble_sort (sorting on the basis of bubble sort algorithm)
                        </br>
                        ->Insertion_sort (sorting on the basis of insertion sort algorithm)
                        </br>
                        ->Selection_sort (sorting on the basis of selection sort algorithm)
