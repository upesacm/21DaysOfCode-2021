Question:

Searching Algorithms in C++ (Linear Search and Binary Search)

- Taking Input of an array and number to be searched from user 
- Using switch statement to call different types of seacrhing techniques as per the choice entered
- Functions included :   
                        </br>
                        ->Linear_Search
                        </br>
                        ->Binary_Search_Asc (For array sorted in ascending order)
                        </br>
                        ->Binary_Search_Desc (For array sorted in descending order)
