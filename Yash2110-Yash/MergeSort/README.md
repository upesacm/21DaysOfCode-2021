Question:

Sort a user defined array in ascending order using MergeSort Algorithm

Functions Included:
                        </br>
                        ->MergeSort(to divide array into two sorted arrays)
                        </br>
                        ->merge(to copy the two sorted parts of the array into two temporary arrays and
                        </br>                        
                         then merging them in such a way that final array is sorted in ascending order)
