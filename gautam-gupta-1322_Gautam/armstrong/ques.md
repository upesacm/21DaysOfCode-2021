## Question : 
write a program to print all the armstrong numbers from 0 to n 
## Solution :
first i made the user enter the value of n, then i used a loop to traverse every number from 0 to n, for each number i checked the number of digits it have and then added each digit of the number by raising them to the power equal to the total number of digitd in that number. after that i compared the sum and that number and if they were equal i printed that number as armstrong.
